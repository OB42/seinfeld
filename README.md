# Seinfeld Simulator

Do you ever wish your life was like an episode of Seinfeld? Where you'd walk into a room to the bass lines of Seinfeld intro theme and a laugh track to go along with your weird sense of humour? Me neither. Which is why I built the Seinfeld simulator.

The simulator uses computer's webcam and micrphone to detect motion and audio. It plays a variety of popular Seinfeld basslines when the webcam detects motion and a laugh track when it detects end of dialogue.

## How does it work?

Seinfeld Simulator is built on top of a variety of browser API's and 3rd party JS libraries to analyse audio and video from your computer's microphone and webcam respectively (see Resources for component JS libraries). Sensitivity to motion and audio input can be adjusted using range selectors to suit your specific environment.

_Please note that this project is highly experimental and therefore only supported by Google Chrome._
